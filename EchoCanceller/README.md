# Echo Canceller and Keyword spotting on Arm Virtual Hardware

This demo is integrating software for an echo canceller and keyword spotting. The code is running on a Cortex-M55 on the [Arm Virtual Hardware](https://arm-software.github.io/AVH/main/overview/html/index.html). The  [Arm Virtual Hardware](https://arm-software.github.io/AVH/main/overview/html/index.html) is interacting with a model of the room acoustic implemented with [OpenModelica](https://www.openmodelica.org/).
