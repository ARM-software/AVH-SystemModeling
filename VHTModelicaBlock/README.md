# README

It is providing the Modelica ARM package containing blocks which are needed for this demo:

- Blocks to read and write wave files (limited support for wav format)
- Block to read FIR coefficients from a `.csv` and run a FIR in Modelica
- Blocks to interface with the [Arm Virtual Hardware](https://arm-software.github.io/AVH/main/overview/html/index.html).

More documentation is available inside the Modelica files (which can be opened with `OMEdit`)
